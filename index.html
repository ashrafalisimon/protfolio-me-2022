                <h4>Mission</h4>
                <p>To become a Web Developer, I should have an understanding of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It’s also recommended to learn about CSS and CSS frameworks. Developing these fundamental web development skills will give you the foundation and logic for communicating with programming languages. Once you have your website, you need to put it on the internet, so people can see it.

            <h3>Develop</h3>
            <h3>Without Limits</h3>
            <p>Just because the code works, doesn’t mean it works correctly. Getting the code to work is only the first hurdle. Code that doesn’t work correctly is as useless as code that doesn’t work at all, and potentially more dangerous.</p>

            <p>All errors missed by Developers will cause program crashes, system failure, data corruption, security breaches, or turn away users who expect reliability. These errors become increasingly expensive to fix as they find their way into production and are discovered by end-users. Just as physical structures require thorough testing to ensure they are “up to code,” software requires the same stringent standards</p>
 
            <p> A good Developer, therefore, adopts a test-driven mindset, actively imagining all scenarios where errors can occur, how they should be handled, and writing tests that prove the code is correct.</p>

            <h3>Global Community</h3>
            <p>Over the past few years lots of developer communities have come together with different goals and missions. But you'll probably agree with me that they all have several things in common:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>They help you learn,</li>
                    <li>They share ideas</li>
                    <li>They offer support to newbies, and</li>
                    <li>You can freely interact with them and within them.</li>
                </ul>
            <p>There are many different types of developer communities out there – front-end focused, back-end focused, and specific language-based. We also have general communities which include all of the above under one platform.</p>
